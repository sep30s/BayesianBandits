# Introduction to Bayesian Linear Regression

- Linear regression
    - A variable is used to predict another variable
    - Linear regression finds best-fitting line to observed data to make further predictions
- The Bayesian approach:
    - Requires the use of prior information
    - Provides a posterior distribution

## Bayesian vs. Frequentist Approach

- Frequentist Approach
    - Typical linear model $$
        y = \beta^TX + \epsilon \tag{1}
        $$
    - A regression coefficient that best fits the line that relates variables [@Koehrsen2018]
- Bayesian Approach
    - Bayes' theorem informs the model [@xiaogang] $$
        f(\theta|D) \propto f(D|\Theta)f(\Theta) \tag{2}
        $$
    - Predictions are made in light of prior knowledge
    - The resulting prediction is not a point estimate, but a
        distribution [@Bayes1991]

## Role of prior knowledge in shaping predictions

- Priors can be subjective or objective
    - objective is preferred
- Noninformative priors can be used when there is not adequate prior
    knowledge
- Discounted priors are the result of adjusting a known prior to
    better reflect the current data[@lesaffre]

# Understanding the Bayesian Framework

::: {layout-ncol=2}

- Bayesâ€™ theorem is used to update prior beliefs about model
    parameters with new data
    - This results in a posterior distribution [@Bayes1991]
- Posterior distribution vs. point estimates
    - measures the uncertainty in predictions
    - richer picture for predictions
    - better uncertainty quantification [@Koehrsen2018]

## Interpreting the Posterior

- The marginal posterior density function (output) may not be available
- Makov Chain Monte Carlo is commonly used
  - Markov chain sequence establishes a sample space from the posterior
  - Integration of samples generated through Monte Carlo techniques from the sample space
- Some popular MCMC algorithms:
  - Gibbs sampler
  - Metropolis-Hastings (MH) [@lesaffre]

# Tools and Techniques in Bayesian Analysis

![BAT logo (https://bat.mpp.mpg.de/?page=home)](images/BAT.png){fig-align="right"}

- The Bayesian Analysis Toolkit (BAT)
  - real-world application of Bayesian methods
  - Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for sampling and model comparison[@Caldwell2009]
  - Visualization tools (trace plots, HMC diagnostics) for model
    assessment [@Gabry2019]

# Advantages of Bayesian Methods

- Findings from Zyphur and Oswald on reliability 
  - Bayesian methods are more reliable with small samples
  - Better predictions and understanding of data [@Zyphur2015]

- Better analysis of complex data due to advancements in computational power
  - e.g. autoencoders [@Van2021]

- Interpretation of posteriors 
  - commonly done with MCMC
  - variational inference has been offered as an alternative [@Blei2017]
  
# Modifications to BLR
  - Kernalization (with Gaussian kernel) and Sparsification[@surfacerough]
  - Warping to handle non-linear trends [@warped]
  - BLR in concert with k-means clustering to creat subdivisions of the population [@bridge]
  - Use with Cauchy prior to improve performance with sparse array input [@cauchyprior]
  - Gridded BLR by means of producing a model grid to predict storm winds [@stormwind]

# Conclusion and Future Directions

- Key strengths of BLR
  - flexibility
  - uncertainty management

- Exploration of MCMC and foundational Bayesian principles

- Potential for future applications in complex data analysis
